## Analytics_Supermarket_Sales

#### Technology Stack:
Power BI (calculated fields, data aggregation, function, API integration, data visualization, dashboard creation)

#### Project Description:
In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyze the "Supermarket Sales" dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains comprehensive information about products, sellers, and customers involved in supermarket transactions over a specific period. I imported this dataset into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

1. Calculated total monthly revenue and depicted it using a suitable line graph for better visualization.
2. Calculated the average product cost for each category and presented the results through a bar chart.
3. Constructed a time series graph illustrating sales volume against the date of sale. Integrated filters by years and months for enhanced analytical capabilities.
4. Developed a bar chart illustrating the number of units sold for each product category, utilizing stacking to demonstrate product distribution by location.
5. Designed a pie chart to showcase the distribution of sales based on payment types (cash, card, etc.), enhancing its informativeness by including values.

Connected to the National Bank of Ukraine's API to fetch the latest dollar exchange rate. Created a table "Currency" to manage currency options (UAH and USD) and integrated a Currency filter for ease of selection in the dashboard. Implemented measures that dynamically adjust based on the chosen currency, utilizing these measures in the corresponding graph and verified their accuracy.
